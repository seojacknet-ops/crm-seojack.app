# Directive: Competitor Intelligence (Nexus Protocol)

## Goal
To actively compare SEOJack's developing features against direct competitors (SPP, ManyRequests) and indirect giants (HoneyBook, Dubsado).

## The Competitor Watchlist
1.  **Direct Rivals (Agency Client Portals):**
    -   *Service Provider Pro (SPP):* The benchmark for "productized service" checkout.
    -   *ManyRequests:* Known for a customizable client portal.
    -   *Client Portal:* Simple, Trello-based integration.
2.  **Indirect Rivals (General CRM):**
    -   *HoneyBook:* The gold standard for "handheld" creative onboarding.
    -   *Dubsado:* Known for complex automation workflows.

## Analysis Vectors
When reviewing a feature (e.g., "Billing"), analyze based on:
1.  **Friction:** How many clicks does the competitor take vs. SEOJack?
2.  **The "Concierge" Factor:** Does the competitor feel robotic? How can SEOJack feel more human?
3.  **Upsell Potential:** How do competitors integrate upsells into this specific flow?

## Output Format
Always structure reports as:
-   **The Feature:** [Name]
-   **The Standard:** How Competitor X does it.
-   **The Gap:** What we are missing or doing generically.
-   **The Kill Shot:** The specific improvement to make SEOJack superior.
