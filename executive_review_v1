Here is my review of the current state of SEOJack CRM, along with specific recommendations to implement before you add the complexity of Firebase and Stripe.

1. Executive Summary
Strengths: Excellent modularity (Feature-based folders), strong UI consistency (Shadcn + Tailwind), and a clear user journey (Onboarding Wizard is a highlight). Usage of zustand with persistence is the perfect choice for this stage.

Weakness: Mobile navigation is currently incomplete, and there is a disconnect between the "Chat Widget" and the "Messages Page."

Verdict: The frontend shell is 85% ready for backend integration.

2. Critical Architecture Review
A. The "Service Layer" Pattern (Crucial before Firebase)
Right now, your logic is inside components or Zustand stores. Before adding Firebase, create a defined interface for your data.

Why: If you hardcode firestore.collection('users') inside your components, refactoring later is a nightmare.

Action: Create a services/ folder.

services/auth.ts (Login, Logout, Reset PW)

services/storage.ts (Upload, Delete, List)

services/database.ts (Generic CRUD)

Benefit: You can keep using Mock data in the service layer while you build, then switch to Firebase just by changing the file content, not the UI components.

B. Unified Messaging State
Issue: You have a ChatWidget.tsx (floating) and a messages/page.tsx (full screen). Currently, they likely don't share state.

Fix: Create a chat-store.ts. Both the Widget and the Page should subscribe to this same store. If a user types in the widget and then opens the full page, the draft should be there.

3. UX/UI Improvements (The "Concierge" Feel)
1. Mobile Navigation (Critical Gap)
I analyzed Sidebar.tsx and Header.tsx.

The Code: Sidebar has hidden md:flex.

The Problem: On mobile screens (<768px), the Sidebar disappears, but Header.tsx has no "Hamburger Menu" button to trigger it. A mobile user is currently trapped on the dashboard.

Fix: Add a Sheet (from Shadcn) to Header.tsx that contains the Sidebar content, triggered by a Menu icon only visible on mobile.

2. "Empty States" are Opportunities
In FileGrid.tsx, you have a basic "No files found" message.

Improvement: In a "Concierge" app, empty states should prompt action.

Code Change:

TypeScript

// Instead of just text:
<div className="text-center">
  <FolderOpen className="mx-auto h-12 w-12 text-gray-400" />
  <h3 className="mt-2 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900">No files yet</h3>
  <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">Upload your logo to get started.</p>
  <div className="mt-6">
    <Button onClick={triggerUpload}>Upload Now</Button> {/* Call to Action */}
  </div>
</div>
3. The Onboarding "Save" Friction
Observation: The Wizard.tsx relies on local storage (via Zustand persist).

Risk: If a user clears cache or switches devices mid-onboarding, they lose progress.

Suggestion: When you integrate Firebase, save the onboarding step to the user document on every step change, not just at the end.

4. Code Specific Refinements
File: src/components/features/billing/PricingCard.tsx

Current: Uses simple logic to determine upgrade/downgrade.

Suggestion: Add a loading state to the buttons. Stripe redirects take 1-3 seconds. If the user clicks "Upgrade" twice, you might create duplicate subscriptions.

File: src/app/layout.tsx

Current: <body className={...}>

Suggestion: You will need a Toaster component here (from sonner or react-hot-toast). You need a global way to show "Profile Updated" or "Upload Failed" notifications without creating local state in every component.

File: src/lib/store/media-store.ts

Current: uploadFile has a setTimeout to simulate delay.

Refinement: When you move to S3/Firebase Storage, file uploads fail often (file too big, bad network). Add an error field to your MediaFile type so you can show a red "Retry" button on the specific file card that failed.

5. Implementation Plan (Before Backend)
I have prepared a "Next Steps" checklist for you to execute before installing the Firebase SDK.

Step 1: Fix Mobile Navigation

Install Shadcn Sheet: npx shadcn@latest add sheet

Update Header.tsx to include the mobile trigger.

Step 2: Add Global Toast Notifications

Install Sonner: npx shadcn@latest add sonner

Add <Toaster /> to layout.tsx.

Replace alert() calls in FileUploader.tsx and Wizard.tsx with toast.success().

Step 3: Define Zod Schemas

You used Zod in NewTicketDialog.tsx (Excellent).

Now, create a lib/schemas.ts file. Define schemas for Onboarding Data and UserProfile. This ensures that when you do connect Firebase, you aren't saving junk data to the DB.
